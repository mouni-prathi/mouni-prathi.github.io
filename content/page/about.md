#### The Init :fireworks:

- Started as a Database Admin. I was drawn to troubleshooting, performance tuning, Automation and monitoring of Databases.  
- My administrative skills allowed me to choose SRE role as more kind of natural selection.  
- Now, I like being SRE. Some say its boring job! But it brings very excitement and the inevitable force with it to you which makes you add more skills everyday and challenges you in every turn.
