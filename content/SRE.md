- As an advocate for Site Reliability Engineering principles, I drive organizational growth and SRE excellence by breaking down silos to improve team collaboration, 
leading blameless postmortems, and enhancing application observability, reliability, and scalability. 
- My approach includes the continuous refinement of SLOs and SLIs based on performance data and user feedback, effectively utilizing error budgets for proactive reliability management.
- Leverage data-driven insights to resolve user incidents, exceptions, and application bottlenecks at their root cause. Engineered and executed site reliability and disaster recovery tests to ensure system resilience. Optimized database and application performance for enhanced user experience. 
- Established and iteratively improved monitoring and alerting based on data patterns. Achieving a measurable reduction in application incidents counts through rigorous analysis, directly improving reliability. 
- Proactively enhanced scalability and reliability through strategic capacity planning. Drove cost efficiencies for the business by implementing FinOps practices informed by usage trends. 
- Managed and streamlined release processes across various stages and technologies, encompassing private clouds (Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, Hadoop) and public cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Expertise in automating solutions (using PowerShell, Python, and Golang) to reduce toil and improve operational efficiency. Adept at troubleshooting complex Spark jobs, data pipelines, and ETL/ELT processes involving dataflow between diverse sources like Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Hadoop, and S3. 
- Experienced in optimizing data retrieval with Dremio and Starburst and managing data Lakehouse environments on AWS Databricks. Proficient in monitoring DAGs using Apache Airflow. 
- Release Management, Managing CI CD Pipelines. Documenting tasks and plans for organization. Collaborating with global team and participating in on-call Rota for incident management and alerts mitigation. Effective planning of on call resources and time for achieving no error executions and delivering goals.
